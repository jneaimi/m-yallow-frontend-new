## New Component Structure

The dashboard redesign follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

```
/components
  /dashboard
    /context
      - DashboardContext.tsx  (Dashboard state management)
    /layout
      - DashboardLayout.tsx   (Main layout container)
      - DashboardHeader.tsx   (Top header with actions)
      - DashboardSidebar.tsx  (Navigation sidebar)
    /widgets
      - ActivityWidget.tsx    (Recent user activity)
      - BookmarksWidget.tsx   (Saved providers)
      - ReviewsWidget.tsx     (User reviews)
      - ProviderStatusWidget.tsx (Provider-specific information)
      - AccountInfoWidget.tsx (User account details)
      - DashboardGrid.tsx     (Widget layout management)
    - index.ts               (Export all dashboard components)
```

## Key Features

### 1. Improved Information Architecture

- **Widget-Based Dashboard**: Content is organized into focused, purpose-specific widgets
- **Contextual Information**: Different content is shown based on user status (new user, regular user, provider)
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Important information is immediately visible, with detailed content accessible via links

### 2. Enhanced Navigation

- **Streamlined Sidebar**: Clear, icon-based navigation with visual indicators for current section
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly menu that adapts to different screen sizes
- **Breadcrumb Navigation**: Helps users understand their location within the dashboard

### 3. Visual Enhancements

- **Consistent Visual Hierarchy**: Clear typography, spacing, and color usage
- **Status Indicators**: Color-coded badges and icons to indicate different states
- **Improved Loading States**: Skeleton loaders for better user experience during data fetching

### 4. Personalization

- **User Context Awareness**: Dashboard adapts to user roles (provider/non-provider)
- **Time-Based Greeting**: Personalized greeting based on time of day
- **Customizable Widgets**: Users can toggle visibility of different dashboard widgets

## Implementation Details

### Dashboard Context

The `DashboardContext` provides a central state management solution for the dashboard, handling:

- User preferences (visible widgets, layout preferences)
- Dashboard state (sidebar open/closed)
- User activity data
- Personalization helpers (time-based greeting, etc.)

### Layout Components

- **DashboardLayout**: The main container component that manages the overall structure
- **DashboardHeader**: Contains user greeting, search, and quick actions
- **DashboardSidebar**: Provides navigation with responsive behavior for mobile devices

### Widget Components

Each widget is self-contained and focuses on a specific type of content:

- **ActivityWidget**: Shows recent user activity and login history
- **BookmarksWidget**: Displays saved providers with visual elements
- **ReviewsWidget**: Shows user reviews with rich information
- **ProviderStatusWidget**: Displays different content based on provider status
- **AccountInfoWidget**: Shows user account details and settings shortcuts

## Usage Guidelines

### Adding the Dashboard to a Page

To use the new dashboard layout in a page:

```tsx
import { DashboardLayout } from '@/components/dashboard/layout/DashboardLayout';
import { AuthWrapper } from '@/components/auth/auth-wrapper';

export function YourPageComponent() {
  return (
    <AuthWrapper loadingText="Loading...">
      <DashboardLayout>
        {/* Your page content here */}
      </DashboardLayout>
    </AuthWrapper>
  );
}
```

### Adding a Widget to the Dashboard

To add a new widget to the dashboard grid:

1. Create a new widget component in `/components/dashboard/widgets`
2. Update the `DashboardGrid` component to include your new widget
3. Add the widget type to the preferences in `DashboardContext`

### Working with Responsive Design

The dashboard is fully responsive with breakpoints for:

- Mobile: < 640px
- Tablet: 640px - 1024px
- Desktop: > 1024px

Use the provided `ResponsiveContainer` component and `useMobile` hook for conditional rendering.

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements for future iterations:

1. **Drag-and-Drop Widget Arrangement**: Allow users to customize widget positions
2. **Widget Minimization**: Add ability to collapse widgets to save space
3. **Dashboard Themes**: Provide additional theming options beyond light/dark mode
4. **Data Visualization Widgets**: Add charts and graphs for provider analytics
5. **Activity Feed Expansion**: More detailed user activity tracking
6. **Notification System**: Integrated notifications within the dashboard

## Migration Guide

For upgrading existing dashboard pages to the new design:

1. Replace direct use of `AuthWrapper` with the new `DashboardLayout` component
2. Move page-specific content inside the layout component
3. Add breadcrumb navigation for consistency
4. Consider splitting large content sections into widgets
