- `app/layout.tsx`

### Created Files:

- `lib/auth/server.ts`
- `lib/auth/client.ts`
- `lib/auth/index.ts`

## Implementation Details

### Environment Variables

The following environment variables have been configured for Clerk authentication:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=<your-publishable-key>
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=<your-secret-key>
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=/sign-in
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL=/sign-up
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_IN_URL=/dashboard
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_UP_URL=/onboarding
```

These variables are loaded by the Next.js application and used by Clerk to configure authentication flows and redirects.

### ClerkProvider Integration

The ClerkProvider has been added to the root layout in `app/layout.tsx`:

```tsx
<ClerkProvider
  appearance={{
    elements: {
      formButtonPrimary:
        "bg-primary hover:bg-primary/90 text-primary-foreground",
      card: "bg-background border border-border shadow-md",
      headerTitle: "text-foreground",
      headerSubtitle: "text-muted-foreground",
      socialButtonsBlockButton:
        "border border-border bg-background text-foreground",
      formFieldLabel: "text-foreground",
      formFieldInput:
        "bg-background text-foreground border-border focus:border-ring",
      footerActionText: "text-muted-foreground",
      footerActionLink: "text-primary hover:text-primary/90",
      identityPreview: "bg-muted text-muted-foreground",
      // Accessibility enhancements
      formFieldLabelRow:
        "focus-within:ring-2 focus-within:ring-ring rounded-sm",
      // Forces high contrast on focused elements
      formFieldInput__focus: "outline-none ring-2 ring-ring ring-offset-2",
    },
  }}
>
  {/* Application content */}
</ClerkProvider>
```

The appearance settings ensure that Clerk's authentication UI components match the application's design system and meet accessibility requirements.

### Authentication Utilities

Server-side authentication utilities have been implemented in `lib/auth/server.ts`:

```typescript
// Key functions
export function getAuthStatus() {
  /* ... */
}
export async function requireAuth() {
  /* ... */
}
export async function getUserData() {
  /* ... */
}
export async function hasRole(role: string) {
  /* ... */
}
```

Client-side authentication utilities have been implemented in `lib/auth/client.ts`:

```typescript
// Key functions and hooks
export function useAuthStatus() {
  /* ... */
}
export function useUserData() {
  /* ... */
}
export function useAuthNavigation() {
  /* ... */
}
export function announceAuthStateChange() {
  /* ... */
}
```

These utilities provide a consistent interface for working with authentication throughout the application.

### Accessibility Features

Authentication-specific accessibility utilities have been implemented in `lib/accessibility/auth.ts`:

```typescript
// Key functions
export function announceAuthStateChange() {
  /* ... */
}
export function manageFocusAfterAuthAction() {
  /* ... */
}
export function getAuthFormProps() {
  /* ... */
}
export function getAuthErrorProps() {
  /* ... */
}
```

The AuthStateAnnouncer component has been added to provide screen reader announcements for authentication state changes:

```tsx
// Key features of AuthStateAnnouncer
// - Tracks authentication state changes
// - Announces sign-in and sign-out events
// - Uses live regions for screen reader compatibility
```

## Accessibility Implementation

The implementation ensures that authentication flows are accessible to all users, including those using assistive technologies:

### Keyboard Accessibility

- All authentication forms are fully keyboard navigable
- Focus management utilities ensure proper focus during authentication flows
- Focus trapping in modal authentication dialogs
- Visible focus indicators with adequate contrast

### Screen Reader Support

- Live regions for announcing authentication state changes
- ARIA attributes for form labels and descriptions
- Error messages are properly associated with form fields
- Success messages are announced to screen readers

### Visual Accessibility

- Color contrast meets WCAG AA requirements (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for UI components)
- Authentication states are conveyed by more than just color
- Clerk UI components styled to match application theme and accessibility requirements

### Cognitive Accessibility

- Clear instructions and error messages
- Consistent navigation and UI patterns
- Helpful feedback for authentication actions

## Middleware Configuration

A Clerk middleware has been implemented to handle authentication for protected routes:

```typescript
import { clerkMiddleware } from "@clerk/nextjs/server";

// Define routes that don't require authentication
const publicRoutes = [
  "/",
  "/sign-in(.*)",
  "/sign-up(.*)",
  "/api/webhooks(.*)",
  "/accessibility-test(.*)",
  "/responsive-demo(.*)",
  "/theme-demo(.*)",
];

// Routes to be ignored by the middleware completely
const ignoredRoutes = [
  "/api/webhooks(.*)", // Clerk webhook routes should be ignored
];

export default clerkMiddleware(async (auth, req) => {
  // Protect all routes except the public ones
  if (
    !publicRoutes.some((pattern) => {
      const regex = new RegExp(`^${pattern}$`);
      return regex.test(req.nextUrl.pathname);
    })
  ) {
    await auth.protect();
  }
});

export const config = {
  matcher: ["/((?!.+\\.[\\w]+$|_next).*)", "/", "/(api|trpc)(.*)"],
};
```

This middleware implementation:

1. Uses `clerkMiddleware` from `@clerk/nextjs/server` which is the recommended approach for Clerk v6.18.0
2. Defines an array of public routes that don't require authentication
3. Uses a callback function with async/await since auth operations are asynchronous
4. Manually checks each route against the public routes list using regex pattern matching
5. Applies `auth.protect()` to any route that is not public, which automatically redirects unauthenticated users to the sign-in page

The middleware ensures that protected routes require authentication while allowing public routes to be accessed without authentication.

## Acceptance Criteria Verification

   - Create password reset flow
   - Implement social authentication options

2. **Protected Routes & Access Control**:

   - Implement page-level protection using auth utilities
   - Create role-based access control for admin features
   - Add user profile and settings pages
   - Implement session management features

3. **Authentication UI Components**:

   - Add auth state indicators in the header
   - Create protected route wrapper components

4. **Testing & Verification**:
   - Test authentication flows with keyboard navigation
   - Verify screen reader compatibility
   - Ensure color contrast meets accessibility requirements
   - Test error handling and form validation
