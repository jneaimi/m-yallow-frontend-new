## Implementation Guidelines

### Code Style and Standards

- Use TypeScript for all new components and functions
- Implement components as function components with hooks
- Follow the "client" / "server" component model of Next.js
- Use CSS variables for theming and styling
- Document all public APIs and components

### Directory Structure

```

### Testing Approach

- Unit test all hooks and utilities
- Component tests for UI components
- Integration tests for feature flows
- End-to-end tests for critical user journeys

### Contributing

When implementing a new feature:

1. Create a new branch from main
2. Implement the feature according to its requirements
3. Add tests for the new functionality
4. Update documentation in the `docs/features` directory
5. Submit a pull request for review

For major features, create three documentation files:
- Main guide (overview, usage, and guidelines)
- Technical spec (architecture, data flow, implementation details)
- Examples (practical code examples showing how to use the feature)
