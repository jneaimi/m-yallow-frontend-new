# FR-10: Public Categories Implementation

## Overview

This document details the implementation of Functional Requirement FR-10, which involves fetching and displaying public categories on the homepage from a dynamic API endpoint.

## API Endpoint

The categories are fetched from:
```
{{base_url}}/public/categories
```

Example response:
```json
{
  "categories": [
    {"id": 10, "name": "Auto Spare Parts", "icon": "settings"},
    {"id": 2, "name": "Building Materials Suppliers", "icon": "bricks"},
    {"id": 6, "name": "Car Maintenance & Repair", "icon": "wrench"},
    {"id": 24, "name": "Cleaning & Janitorial Supplies", "icon": "broom"},
    {"id": 8, "name": "Construction Companies", "icon": "hammer"},
    {"id": 18, "name": "Electrical Supplies & Services", "icon": "zap"},
    {"id": 29, "name": "General Trading & Wholesale", "icon": "store"},
    {"id": 19, "name": "HVAC & Cooling Systems", "icon": "wind"},
    {"id": 23, "name": "Industrial Chemicals", "icon": "beaker"},
    {"id": 21, "name": "Logistics & Freight", "icon": "truck"},
    {"id": 27, "name": "Office & Industrial Furniture", "icon": "chair"},
    {"id": 20, "name": "Paints & Coatings", "icon": "paintbrush"},
    {"id": 28, "name": "Pest Control & Facility Services", "icon": "bug"},
    {"id": 3, "name": "Plumbing & Sanitary Ware", "icon": "pipe"},
    {"id": 7, "name": "Power Tools & Equipment", "icon": "tool"},
    {"id": 25, "name": "Security & CCTV", "icon": "camera"},
    {"id": 4, "name": "Signage & Printing", "icon": "type"},
    {"id": 14, "name": "Steel & Metal Works", "icon": "anvil"},
    {"id": 9, "name": "Tire Shops & Alignment", "icon": "circle"},
    {"id": 22, "name": "Warehouse & Storage", "icon": "warehouse"},
    {"id": 5, "name": "Welding & Fabrication", "icon": "flame"}
  ],
  "total": 21
}
```

## Implementation Components

### 1. Categories API Service

**File**: `/lib/api/categories.ts`

This service provides functions for interacting with category-related API endpoints, including:
- API endpoint constants
- TypeScript interfaces for API responses
- Function to fetch public categories

### 2. Icon Mapping Utility

**File**: `/lib/api/icon-mapping.tsx`

This utility maps string icon identifiers from the API to Lucide React components:
- Contains a mapping object of icon strings to React components
- Provides a function to retrieve an icon component by its string identifier
- Includes fallbacks for unknown icons
- Uses available Lucide icons from version 0.503.0

**Note on Icon Compatibility:**
For some API icon names, direct matching Lucide icons weren't available. In these cases, we've used the closest visual alternatives:
- For "chair" → Using LampDesk icon (office furniture)
- For "beaker" → Using FlaskConical icon (lab equipment)
- For "bricks" → Using Building2 icon (construction)
- For "broom" → Using Brush icon (cleaning)
- For "anvil" → Using Hammer icon (metalwork)
- For "pipe" → Using Tool icon (plumbing)

The icon mapping now includes all industrial and construction category icons from the API:
- settings (Auto Spare Parts) → Settings icon
- bricks (Building Materials Suppliers) → Building2 icon
- wrench (Car Maintenance & Repair) → Wrench icon
- broom (Cleaning & Janitorial Supplies) → Brush icon
- hammer (Construction Companies) → Hammer icon
- zap (Electrical Supplies & Services) → Zap icon
- store (General Trading & Wholesale) → Store icon
- wind (HVAC & Cooling Systems) → Wind icon
- beaker (Industrial Chemicals) → FlaskConical icon
- truck (Logistics & Freight) → Truck icon
- chair (Office & Industrial Furniture) → LampDesk icon
- paintbrush (Paints & Coatings) → PaintBucket icon
- bug (Pest Control & Facility Services) → Bug icon
- pipe (Plumbing & Sanitary Ware) → Tool icon
- tool (Power Tools & Equipment) → Tool icon
- camera (Security & CCTV) → Camera icon
- type (Signage & Printing) → Type icon
- anvil (Steel & Metal Works) → Hammer icon
- circle (Tire Shops & Alignment) → CircleDot icon
- warehouse (Warehouse & Storage) → Warehouse icon
- flame (Welding & Fabrication) → Flame icon

### 3. Public Categories Server Component

**File**: `/app/providers/public-categories.tsx`

This server component:
- Fetches categories from the API
- Transforms API data to match the component requirements
- Handles errors by falling back to static categories
- Renders using the existing FeaturedCategories component

### 4. UI Component Updates

### 4.1 FeaturedCategories Component

**File**: `/components/providers/featured-categories.tsx`

The FeaturedCategories component has been updated to:
- Support more grid columns (5 columns on extra-large screens)
- Use a more compact card layout to accommodate more categories
- Optimize spacing and font sizes for better readability with many categories

### 4.2 Homepage Integration

**File**: `/app/page.tsx`

Updates to the homepage include:
- Replacing static categories with the dynamic PublicCategories component
- Adding a loading state using Suspense

### 5. Test Page

**File**: `/app/test-categories/page.tsx`

A dedicated page for testing the categories implementation:
- Shows the expected API response
- Renders the categories component
- Provides visual feedback on the implementation

## Fallback Strategy

If the API request fails, the implementation falls back to the static categories defined in `category-icons.tsx`. This ensures that users always see category options even if there are backend issues.

## Future Enhancements

Potential future enhancements include:
1. Adding a caching layer for better performance (using SWR or React Query)
2. Implementing category prioritization (allow admins to prioritize which categories appear first)
3. Supporting custom category images in addition to icons
4. Enhancing search integration with selected categories
5. Adding pagination or "Show More" functionality for handling large numbers of categories
6. Organizing categories into groups/sections for easier navigation
7. Creating an admin interface for managing icon mappings
8. Implementing category filtering or search on the categories page

## Testing

To test the implementation:
1. Run the application and visit the homepage
2. Verify that categories are displayed correctly
3. Visit the `/test-categories` page for more detailed testing
4. Test error handling by temporarily disabling the API endpoint
